# Security Policy

The team behind this project takes security very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Guiding Principles

*   We are committed to addressing security issues in a timely manner.
*   We believe in transparent and responsible disclosure.
*   We value the contributions of the security research community.

## Supported Versions

This is a web-based service that follows a continuous deployment model. As such, **only the latest version of the code deployed and running is considered supported.**

If you discover a vulnerability, please verify that it is reproducible on the latest version of the code in the `main` branch before submitting a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are grateful for any and all security reports. To ensure the safety of our users, we ask that you report vulnerabilities privately.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

The best way to report a vulnerability is directly through **GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature**.

1.  Navigate to the "Security" tab of our repository.
2.  Click on "Report a vulnerability".
3.  Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including:
    *   A clear description of the vulnerability.
    *   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
    *   Proof-of-concept, screenshots, or code snippets if possible.
    *   The potential impact of the vulnerability.

This is our preferred method as it allows for private discussion and collaboration.

### Alternative Method: Email

If you are unable to use GitHub Security Advisories, you can send your report via email to **haoweiw370@gmail.com**. Please use a clear subject line, such as "Security Vulnerability Report for [Your Project Name]".

### Our Process (What to Expect)

Once we receive your vulnerability report, we will follow this process:

1.  **Acknowledgement**: We will strive to acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
2.  **Initial Assessment**: We will conduct an initial assessment to confirm the vulnerability. We aim to complete this within **7 days** of acknowledgement.
3.  **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress as we work on a fix. The timeline for a fix can vary greatly depending on the complexity and severity of the issue.
4.  **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is patched, we will coordinate with you on the public disclosure. We will credit you for your discovery in the disclosure advisory, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

### Out of Scope Vulnerabilities

The following issues are generally considered out of scope:

*   Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device.
*   Social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing).
*   Reports from automated scanners without a proof-of-concept demonstrating a specific vulnerability.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that require an excessive amount of resources.
*   Missing security headers that do not directly lead to a vulnerability.

We thank you for your help in keeping our project and its users safe.
